Movie Recommendation System using TDMB Data
This project implements a movie recommendation system based on data obtained from TDMB (The Data Movie Base). The system filters out unwanted attributes, such as irrelevant metadata, and focuses on important features like genre, cast, and crew. These attributes are combined into a tag in the form of a vector representation for each movie. Stop words are removed to enhance the efficiency of the system.
